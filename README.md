# switchify

switchify is a tiny plugin for jQuery that replaces checkbox inputs with an iPhone UI switch control. 


## Getting started ðŸš€

Follow these instructions to use switchify on your project.


### Pre-requisites ðŸ“‹

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development and production machines:

* jQuery - [Download jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/). Of course, being a jQuery plugin, switchify needs jQuery to work.

### Installation ðŸ”§

Include switchify's .js and .css files on your page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="switchify.css">
<script src="switchify.js"></script>
```


### Initialization ðŸ“¦

The switchify needs to be initiated when the target DOM element is ready. The safest bet is to start it on window `onload` event or jQuery's document.ready, but it can also be launched on a script tag positioned below the element.

```html
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../src/switchify.css">
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="../src/switchify.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<input type="checkbox" name="option1" />
	<script>

		$('input[type=checkbox]').switchify();
		
	</script>
</body>
```
